# STAT 443 Final Project
_Subin Cho, Chenfei Hu, Jiaqi Kang, & Jonas Reger_

For this project we performed regression analysis on the "Gas Turbine CO and NOx Emission" Data Set from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+Turbine+CO+and+NOx+Emission+Data+Set#). Our goal was to find meaningful relationships between the input predictors (Ambient and Process variables) and carbon monoxide emissions (Gas Emission variable) in order to provide our mock client with the means to reduce overall carbon monoxide emissions from their gas turbines.
